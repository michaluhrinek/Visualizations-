# Renewable and Nuclear Energy Visualizations

This repository contains interactive visualizations and analyses focused on renewable and nuclear energy production worldwide, with a particular emphasis on Slovakia. Utilizing powerful libraries such as **Plotly**, **Seaborn**, **Folium**, and **Matplotlib**, this project aims to provide insightful representations of energy data over the years.

## Features

- **Dynamic Visualizations**: Explore various chart types including line charts, bar charts, ridgeline plots, and parallel coordinates that illustrate trends in energy production and consumption.
  
- **Interactive Maps**: Utilize Folium to create geographical representations of energy sources, allowing users to visualize the distribution and impact of renewable and nuclear energy across different regions.

- **Detailed Analysis for Slovakia**: Focus on Slovakia's energy landscape, showcasing how the country has evolved in its energy production, particularly in nuclear power.

- **Comprehensive Dataset**: The visualizations are powered by a rich dataset that includes metrics such as electricity generation from various sources (renewable, fossil fuels, nuclear), GDP per capita, and renewable energy shares in total consumption.

- **Trend Analysis**: Examine how Slovakia's energy policies have influenced production trends over the years, with insights into the shift towards renewable sources.

## Technologies Used

- **Plotly**: For creating interactive plots that enhance data exploration.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization that complements Plotly's capabilities.
- **Folium**: For generating interactive maps that visualize geographical data related to energy sources.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations to represent energy data effectively.

## Usage
Open Jupyter Notebook or your preferred Python environment.
